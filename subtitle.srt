00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,159
I recently watched this data fetching

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,680
video by Josh and I was shocked how bad

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,279
the advice was if every single website

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,719
implemented what he said to do 50% of

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:11,480
the entire world would no longer be able

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,440
to access the internet so in this video

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,719
I'm going to be talking about what is

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,800
wrong with his advice as well as showing

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,560
what you can do instead to solve the

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,520
problem he was trying to

11
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:25,160
fix welcome back to web dev simplified

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,519
my name is Kyle and my job is to

13
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,000
simplify the web for you so you can

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,759
start building your dream project sooner

15
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:31,560
and in J's video the problem he was

16
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,840
trying to solve is when you're

17
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,879
requesting data from a server if the

18
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:36,879
server is really slow what do you do to

19
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:38,800
let the user know in our case when I

20
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,520
click this load users button you can see

21
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,160
our data loaded almost instantaneously

22
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,840
as you can see I have an API set up and

23
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,640
I have the delay set to 10 milliseconds

24
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,239
so as you can see it's a very quick data

25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,840
Fetch and that's because I have fast

26
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,520
internet I'm hardwired in and all of

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,680
that what happens if there is a problem

28
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,960
with the server and the server was

29
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,640
taking longer than usual to respond

30
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,039
because there's too many requests coming

31
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:00,359
in let's say instead of 10 millisecond

32
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,480
this actually was taking 10 seconds so

33
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,040
if we restart our server and I just

34
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,840
refresh this page and I click load users

35
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,320
you're now going to notice it's stuck in

36
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,600
this loading State and it's going to be

37
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,400
stuck there for 10 seconds which is

38
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,400
obviously not a good user experience I

39
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,080
may think that your site is broken and I

40
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,320
may leave because I'm like what the heck

41
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,799
there's a problem with your site

42
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,080
eventually the data gets there but it

43
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,439
takes a really long time what Josh

44
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:21,880
proposed that you do to solve this

45
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,400
problem is inside of your code where

46
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,720
you're fetching out your user

47
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,720
information this is pretty much a basic

48
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,000
fetch request where we're just setting

49
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,640
our loading State then we're getting our

50
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,360
dat setting it to success if we have an

51
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,159
error we set it to an error and that's

52
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,960
all that's happening but inside of here

53
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,880
we're setting a timeout this is Josh's

54
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,799
idea is that if your request takes too

55
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,240
long in our example we're just saying 2

56
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,680
seconds if it takes longer than 2

57
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,360
seconds just cancel the request

58
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,439
completely because there's probably

59
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,200
something wrong with your server so now

60
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,000
you can see if I save that refresh and

61
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,680
click load it's going to wait 2 seconds

62
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,840
and then I'm going to get an error

63
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,799
because this timeout ran it canceled my

64
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,240
request and it went into this catch

65
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,840
block right here with an error now

66
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,560
technically doing this will solve the

67
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,960
problem that we came into where we have

68
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,479
extra long loading states that are

69
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,560
probably a problem with our server but

70
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,640
the problem that this introduces is that

71
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,680
now if you're on a slow connection for

72
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,440
example if you have really bad data

73
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,199
connection I'm very used to this living

74
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,959
in Nebraska it's like the whole for all

75
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,680
data connection Maps but if you have

76
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,280
really slow data connection or you just

77
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,519
have a slow internet connection in

78
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:18,040
general you're going to hit this 2C

79
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,160
timeout and you're not going to be able

80
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,280
to access data at all and a large

81
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,800
portion of the world is living on 3G or

82
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,040
slower data so it's always going to take

83
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,080
them longer than 2 3 4 seconds to

84
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,120
request data from the server which means

85
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,440
they're never going to be able to access

86
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,040
anything cuz it's just airing out before

87
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,760
the data ever gets there now I love

88
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,400
Josh's videos I think he does a really

89
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,000
good job but unfortunately in this

90
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,519
regard I think he kind of dropped the

91
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,120
ball and it's perfectly okay he was

92
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,599
solving a problem and he solved it he

93
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,760
just didn't really think about some of

94
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,560
the edge cases so I want to show you an

95
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,319
alternative solution that does the exact

96
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,879
same thing of solving the problem but

97
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,800
doesn't ever degrade the experience for

98
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,040
anyone else so the easiest thing by far

99
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,640
that we can do is instead of canceling

100
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,560
our request here instead we just want to

101
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,360
notify the user that there is some type

102
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,040
of delay going on so instead of

103
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,080
canceling the request we're going to

104
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,440
remove this canceling code I'm just

105
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,000
going to comment it out for now we'll

106
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,640
comment this out and we'll comment out

107
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,840
the section where we're adding in the

108
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,400
signal for cancelling that's all of our

109
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
cancel code removed and instead when the

110
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,360
request is taking too long to get back

111
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,239
to us I'm going to set a new fetch

112
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,920
status and this one I'm going to set to

113
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,599
delayed saying that this response is

114
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,280
delayed compared to what we expect it

115
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,080
shouldn't be taking this long and this

116
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,319
may be 2 seconds 3 seconds 4 seconds 5

117
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,440
seconds it's whatever your app needs so

118
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,760
now we can actually take that delay

119
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,799
response come in here and when our fetch

120
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,560
status is equal to to delayed we can

121
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,200
actually render out a message to our

122
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,760
users so let's just render out a div

123
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,560
that says this response is taking longer

124
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,159
than normal that looks pretty good and

125
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,680
up here just to make sure our button is

126
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,080
properly disabled because we still want

127
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,000
it to be disabled when our fetch status

128
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,519
is equal to delayed we're just going to

129
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,519
add that in like this so now I'm going

130
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,159
to click on load users you can see it's

131
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,920
loading and after a couple seconds you

132
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,400
can now see it says hey this response is

133
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,159
taking longer than normal but it's still

134
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,239
processing my response in the background

135
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,159
and after that full 10-second delay I

136
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,599
will see the data show up just like you

137
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,200
saw and now I can click the button again

138
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,840
or do whatever else I want so I'm

139
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,360
getting the Best of Both Worlds when I

140
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,879
click this button and the data is taking

141
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,319
too long to get back to me I'm giving

142
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:11,159
the user a message saying hey there's

143
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,439
probably something wrong with our server

144
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,640
this is why it's taking longer than

145
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,319
normal you know this is perfectly normal

146
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,720
don't worry about it we're still working

147
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,918
on this but for the slower browsers you

148
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:20,279
can see we're still getting that data

149
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,560
back instead of just canceling out of

150
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,320
the response completely we can even take

151
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,120
this a step further by actually adding

152
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,680
in like a cancel button so what we can

153
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,120
do inside here this response is taking

154
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,080
longer than normal it is still running

155
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,800
in the background if you want you can

156
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,120
cancel the request and rryy it obviously

157
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,560
you can use whatever normal copy you

158
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,080
want but inside here I'm just going to

159
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,720
add a cancel button so let's just come

160
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,919
in here make sure I have this fragment

161
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,840
to close everything off and we'll add in

162
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,840
a button and this button will say cancel

163
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,520
just like that so now if I click load

164
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,320
users after 2 seconds you will see that

165
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,919
this cancel button will pop up and I can

166
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,280
click on it but I need to make it

167
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,560
actually cancel my request so to do that

168
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,400
I'm going to create my abort controller

169
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,240
here just like I was before I want to

170
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,199
pass along my signal so I can actually

171
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,720
cancel my request but instead of

172
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,440
canceling it in this timeout i instead

173
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,039
want to cancel it down here when I click

174
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:14,600
on this button so on click I want to run

175
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,240
some code that's going to essentially

176
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,960
call controller. abort now in order to

177
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,720
get this controller to abort things I

178
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,479
need to store it inside of a reference

179
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,960
so we can just say here const controller

180
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,960
ref is equal to use ref and then we can

181
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,039
say our controller ref urrent is equal

182
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,160
to that and here our controller ref.

183
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,759
current. signal and down here controller

184
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,319
ref. current. abort so now all this is

185
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,919
saying is that we can abort the request

186
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:42,600
directly from inside of here so now if I

187
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,520
click load users you can see after 2

188
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,880
seconds I get this message and if I

189
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,280
click cancel you can see it cancels

190
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,639
everything out and gives me back this

191
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,840
error response if I want I can even come

192
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,160
in here and I can say if e.name is equal

193
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,800
to abort

194
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,120
controller well then I can set my fet

195
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,840
fetch stus to something like

196
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,960
canceled or we'll just say canel there

197
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,680
we go otherwise I'll set it to error

198
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,400
because this is going to be called

199
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,919
anytime I actually cancel it with an

200
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,520
abort request it's going to come into

201
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,280
this code and then I could you know just

202
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,400
copy this we'll say if it's

203
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,120
cancelled canell we'll just render out

204
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,960
the text cancelled

205
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,440
instead there we go so now if I click

206
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,120
load users you can see it's waiting

207
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,560
after 2 seconds I'll get this message

208
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,319
when I click cancel you can see that my

209
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,960
error is incorrect and that's because

210
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,360
that this instead of saying abort

211
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,960
controller should say abort error that

212
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,360
was just a type on my end so now let's

213
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,280
click load user you can see it's loading

214
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,479
I'm going to get this cancel and now you

215
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:39,960
can see it say canceled right here now I

216
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,520
don't want this video to be an attack on

217
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,199
Josh or anything like that I think his

218
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,560
content is really great I'll actually

219
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,000
put a link to his channel on the screen

220
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,240
so you can check out some of his other

221
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,160
videos I just saw this recent video and

222
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,000
I had to make a response to it because I

223
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,240
really didn't like the advice being

224
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,800
shown there and I wanted to show you

225
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,199
guys a way to do the exact same thing

226
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,759
he's trying to solve but in a much

227
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,319
better way
